#+TITLE: Clawe

A Clojure-centric AwesomeWM configuration.

- AwesomeWM provides the api and mental model for window management
- Clojure provides a fantastic language, an interactive repl, etc etc
  + Babashka makes it reasonable to develop in a clojure repl and have a result
    as accessible as a bash script

Clawe pulls these things together to provide a reasonable feedback loop while
working on your development environment.

This repo contains a full awesome configuration in the `awesome` directory. It
is written almost entirely in Fennel, which is a clojure-y lisp that compiles to
lua.

This repo leans heavily on Ralphie for miscellanenous namespaces and utilities.
I debated about writing this entirely inside of Ralphie, but instead I hope it's
the first successful consumer - this should help whip it into shape so that
other projects can easily benefit from it.
